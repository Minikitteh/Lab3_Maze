# Project 3: LCD Game
## Dango Maze
A little ball living life in a maze. He dies once he hits a wall then gets
#revived. There are no winners in this game.

## Help Recieved From:

Hiram Rios (CS) also did a maze and helped me getting started and setting up
most of the game. Aleksandr Diamond (CS) and Miguel Nunez (CS) helped me
understand collisions, and more concepts, like layers, pixels and structs by our TA Daniel.

## How To Run The Game
   1. run command "make install" in each lib subdirs.
   2. in maze, run command "make load"
      - Game should then be uploaded onto the msp430 & ready to play
## How To Play
   - left button: moves the dango up
   - mid left button: moves it down
   - mid right: moves it left
   -right button: moves it right

   -you die if you run into most walls (the top left wall doesn't work,
    neither does the border if you run thru it)
